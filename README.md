# Hello-World
My first repository on GitHub
My name is Michael B and I have always wanted to join the IT world. I want to learn as much as I can in the Cyber Security field. It is hard finding people in the field to interview due to the fact they are very busy and or stressed with tasks. I have High school Deploma from a respected High School, and some college credits including Early childhood development and CYBER SECURITY (networking 170)
